# Preface {-}

This is a bookdown book which was used as a testbed for
developing Speegle, Clair "Foundations of Statistics with R" [@fosbook].

This book has all the bells and whistles of the big book without any of the content.
This book has (and demonstrates):

* Numbered theorems, examples, etc.
* "alert" and "tryit" environments.
* Numbered exercises with solutions.
* An index.
* Vignettes.
* Good looking html and latex output.
* A makefile that can perform single-chapter PDF builds.
* A clean directory and file structure.
